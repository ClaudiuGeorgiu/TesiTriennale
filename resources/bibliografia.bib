   abstract    = {Computer vision applications have come to rely
                 increasingly on superpixels in recent years, but it is
                 not always clear what constitutes a good superpixel
                 algorithm. In an effort to understand the benefits and
                 drawbacks of existing methods, we empirically compare
                 five state-of-the-art superpixel algorithms for their
                 ability to adhere to image boundaries, speed, memory
                 efficiency, and their impact on segmentation performance.
                 We then introduce a new superpixel algorithm, simple
                 linear iterative clustering (SLIC), which adapts a
                 k-means clustering approach to efficiently generate
                 superpixels. Despite its simplicity, SLIC adheres to
                 boundaries as well as or better than previous methods. At
                 the same time, it is faster and more memory efficient,
                 improves segmentation performance, and is straightforward
                 to extend to supervoxel generation.},

	step (after clustering) which now gives more reliable superpixels - the newly 
	established segments are more homogeneous. The improvements of speed

   abstract={Super pixels are a compact and simple representation of images that has been used for many computer vision applications such as object localization, segmentation and depth estimation. While useful as compact representations of images, the time complexity of super pixel algorithms has prevented their use in real-time applications like video processing. Fast super pixel algorithms have been proposed recently but they lack regular structure or required accuracy for representing image structure. We present Grid Seams, a novel seam carving approach to super pixel generation that preserves image structure information while enforcing a global spatial constraint in the form of a grid structure cost. Using a standard dataset, we show that our approach is faster than existing approaches and can achieve accuracies close to a state-of-the-art super pixel generation algorithms.},

   abstract={The computational cost of video and motion analysis can be dramatically reduced by over-segmenting each frame of video into "superpixels". But most superpixel algorithms are themselves computationally expensive, and are thus inappropriate for use with real-time video. This paper advocates and analyzes the use of superpixels derived from minimum-cost paths that can be computed by dynamic programming. It is shown that superpixels can be computed comfortably in real time using such methods (30-40 times faster than the most efficient alternative), while sacrificing about 3% in the accuracy of the superpixels. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated with a simple video analysis application.},
